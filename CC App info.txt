                         CC APP - CONVERTER & CALCULATOR
                    A Fast, Powerful, and Simple All-In-One Tool
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
CC App is a comprehensive web-based unit converter and calculator suite designed to cater to a wide range of users, from students and professionals to gamers and hobbyists. Built using Flask for the backend and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the app delivers fast, accurate, and reliable conversions and calculations across hundreds of units and mathematical functions.

The app is structured to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, featuring a modern, responsive interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. It supports both dark and light themes, allowing users to customize the appearance to their preference. Persistent local storage ensures that user settings, calculator history, and preferences are saved between sessions, providing a consistent and personalized experience.

Key highlights of the CC App include:
- **Unit Converter**: Supports conversions across standard categories like length, mass, time, temperature, area, volume, speed, and more. It also includes advanced conversions for specialized fields such as sound intensity, data storage, and pressure.
- **Basic Calculator**: Offers standard arithmetic operations, parentheses support, memory functions, and a history feature for quick recall of previous calculations.
- **Game Calculator**: Tailored for gamers, this tool includes DPS (Damage Per Second) calculations, TTK (Time To Kill) analysis, reload time optimization, and weapon rotation efficiency metrics.
- **Graphing Calculator**: Enables users to plot mathematical functions with real-time validation, auto-scaling, and manual range adjustments. It supports a wide array of mathematical functions, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential operations.
- **Settings & Customization**: Provides extensive options for personalizing the app, including theme selection, default preferences, and the ability to export/import settings as JSON files for backup and restoration.

The app runs locally on your machine, hosted on a lightweight Flask server. This ensures that all conversions and calculations are processed locally, enhancing both performance and privacy. With its robust architecture and modular design, the CC App is not only a powerful tool for everyday use but also a platform that can be easily extended with new features and enhancements in the future.

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: Flask app won't start
  Solution: Install Flask with: pip install flask
            Ensure Python 3.x is installed
            Check port 5000 is not in use

Issue: Conversions show incorrect results
  Solution: Check conversion factors in app.py FACTORS dictionary
            Verify unit names match exactly (case-sensitive)
            Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)

Issue: Graphing appears blank
  Solution: Verify expression syntax (use * for multiplication, not implicit)
            Check X range is valid (min < max)
            Ensure function returns finite values in range
            Try simpler function first (sin(x) or x²)

Issue: Settings not saving
  Solution: Enable LocalStorage in browser (not in private/incognito mode)
            Check browser's storage quota
            Try exporting settings as JSON backup

Issue: Calculator history disappeared
  Solution: Clear history via Settings page button
            Check if localStorage was cleared
            Re-import settings JSON if backed up


PERFORMANCE NOTES
================================================================================

Conversion Speed: < 1ms for any conversion
Calculator: < 10ms for complex expressions
Graphing: 500-2000ms depending on function complexity and resolution
Memory: < 5MB typical usage (varies with history size)

Optimization tips:
  - Disable history in Settings for slight performance boost
  - Use "Low" graph resolution for faster plotting
  - Keep browser tab active for best performance


SECURITY & PRIVACY
================================================================================

- All conversions/calculations run locally (no server processing after initial page load)
- Settings and history stored in browser LocalStorage only
- No personal data collection
- No tracking (Google Analytics GTM is opt-out via browser settings)
- Export files are plain JSON, human-readable
